# A_Hexaband_Slotted_Patch_Antenna
In this Project, a Hexaband Slotted Patch Antenna is proposed for 5G (3.0 GHz), 
GPS L5 (1.17 GHz), Cordless Telecommunication (1.9 GHz), Wireless Local Area 
Network (WLAN) IEEE 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz), LTE (Long Term Evolution) (0.7 GHz) 
and Radio navigation (1.3 GHz) applications. Here, the patch antenna is optimized to 
resonate at 0.7, 1.17, 1.9 and 2.4 GHz respectively, being fed by a single microstrip feed
line. Also, additional hybrid modes are made to resonate at 1.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. A 
rotated and inverted S-shaped slot is etched on the patch metal to split surface currents 
of each of the modes into two orthogonal and 90â—¦ phase-shifted versions, enabling the 
antenna to radiate Circularly Polarized waves. While supporting CP operation, the 
proposed antenna is simply proximity-fed by a single microstrip line, which omits the 
need for external feeding networks and reduces the cost and complexity. The proposed 
antenna gain ranges from 2.71 dB to 3.98 dB over the operating bands
